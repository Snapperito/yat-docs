## Initializing a Workspace

To start a new workspace that already follows all of YAT's guidelines, quit and reopen QLab (if applicable) to bring you to the home screen. From there, Click "<u>0-400 EVENS</u>," or whatever template is relevant to your use case.

This will in turn, open a new workspace, with preconfigured settings and lighting cues.
